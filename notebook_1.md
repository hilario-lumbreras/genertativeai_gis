Subtask 1: Generative AI Overview
Research and Summary:

Write a brief summary of generative AI, focusing on its principles and applications in general and within geospatial contexts.
Include examples of how generative AI has been used in mapping, data creation, or prediction.
Installation and Setup:

Ensure the necessary Python libraries for generative AI (like OpenAI's GPT, Hugging Face Transformers, or other relevant tools) are installed.
Provide instructions on setting up the environment, including any API keys or configurations needed for PromptFlow.
Subtask 2: Exploring PromptFlow
Introduction to PromptFlow:

Give an overview of PromptFlow, highlighting its purpose and utility in automating prompt-based workflows.
Basic PromptFlow Example:

Create a simple example where PromptFlow is used to generate text or geospatial descriptions based on a given prompt.
Walk through the code, explaining how PromptFlow interprets and executes the prompts.
Experimentation:

Encourage experimentation by changing prompts and observing how the outputs change, demonstrating PromptFlow's flexibility and capabilities.
Subtask 3: GIS Data Visualization
Loading Geospatial Data:

Provide a small, well-known geospatial dataset (e.g., country boundaries shapefile or GeoJSON).
Load the dataset using GeoPandas, and ensure itâ€™s ready for visualization.
Data Visualization:

Create basic visualizations of the geospatial data, such as plotting the boundaries or overlaying layers.
Discuss how these visualizations can be enhanced or interpreted using generative AI.
Integrating AI Outputs:

Demonstrate how AI-generated content from PromptFlow can be annotated or incorporated into the visualized data, such as adding text descriptions or generating hypothetical features.
Subtask 4: Introduction to AutoGen
Overview of AutoGen:

Introduce AutoGen, explaining its role in automating and enhancing workflows in a GIS context.
Simple AutoGen Integration:

Provide a basic example of how AutoGen can be integrated into the current workflow, such as automating the setup or execution of the PromptFlow tasks.
Explain the benefits of using AutoGen in geospatial workflows, focusing on efficiency and scalability.
Hands-On Exercise:

Guide the user through a hands-on exercise where they implement a simple AutoGen task that runs the previously created PromptFlow example.
Encourage users to modify the AutoGen script to explore different automation scenarios.
Wrap-Up and Reflection
Summary of Learnings:

Recap the key concepts covered in the notebook, emphasizing the integration of generative AI with GIS.
Highlight the potential applications of these techniques in real-world scenarios.
Next Steps:

Suggest possible next steps or extensions to the notebook, such as deeper integration of AutoGen or exploring more complex PromptFlow use cases.
Provide a teaser for the next notebook in the series, focusing on how agents will be introduced.
